Morgan Stanley Private Equity Secondaries, an investment team within Morgan Stanley Investment Management, seeks to deliver innovative private market solutions to a global client base. As part of Morgan Stanley Private Credit & Equity (PC&E), a broader division of dedicated private markets focused professionals, the secondaries business draws on decades of investment experience across private markets. With a focus on GP-Led secondaries transactions in developed buyout and growth markets, the Team structures compelling opportunities within less efficient markets and has deployed over 4.6 billion to 54 GP-Led Continuation Vehicle transactions across North America and Europe, as of September 30, 2024. The Teams investment strategy focuses on GP-led private equity secondary transactions, primarily in situations that entail a restructuring or recapitalization of a single asset managed by a high quality lower middle market private equity sponsor. The Teams approach to each investment is bespoke, tailored to provide an optimal solution to each of the stakeholders in a transaction, which requires transaction expertise, thorough due diligence, and careful crafting to achieve the desired objectives for all parties involved.

Morgan Stanley Private Equity Secondaries, an investment team within Morgan Stanley Investment Management, seeks to deliver innovative private market solutions to a global client base. As part of Morgan Stanley Private Credit & Equity (PC&E), a broader division of dedicated private markets focused professionals, the secondaries business draws on decades of investment experience across private markets. With a focus on GP-Led secondaries transactions in developed buyout and growth markets, the Team structures compelling opportunities within less efficient markets and has deployed over 4.6 billion to 54 GP-Led Continuation Vehicle transactions across North America and Europe, as of September 30, 2024. The Teams investment strategy focuses on GP-led private equity secondary transactions, primarily in situations that entail a restructuring or recapitalization of a single asset managed by a high quality lower middle market private equity sponsor. The Teams approach to each investment is bespoke, tailored to provide an optimal solution to each of the stakeholders in a transaction, which requires transaction expertise, thorough due diligence, and careful crafting to achieve the desired objectives for all parties involved. In addition to providing liquidity to existing limited partners, the key driving factors for these transactions typically include a variety of goals such as restoring alignment between the manager and investors, providing the manager with more time to create value, and financing tactical growth capital. In each situation, the Team approaches the transaction with the aim of providing a capital-based solution to the structural issue being addressed, with a core focus on ensuring strong alignment with a high caliber private equity sponsor and the Funds investors.
